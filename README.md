# text format wizard

*this project is under construction*

## what this

text format issues begone!
gone are the days of ad-ridden poor-quality online tools! now you can do it in one place and in a more powerful manner.

## what about cyberchef?

i had no idea that cyberchef existed before making this<br>
this is not a replacement for cyberchef nor a competitor

## try now

it can be found at [quasar.name/text-format-wizard](https://quasar.name/text-format-wizard/)<br>
if it's not working, it's because my server crashed probably<br>
you can try cloning, running `npm i`, and then `npm run dev` and going to `http://localhost:5173` instead

## cool packages that i used

- uses [svelte](https://svelte.dev/), a front-end component framework
- uses [svrollbar](https://github.com/daylilyfield/svrollbar), a scrollbar component for svelte
- uses [svelte-css-vars](https://github.com/kaisermann/svelte-css-vars) for dynamic css
- uses [fuse.js](https://fusejs.io/) for quick module finder

## why text format "wizard"?

this is an unexpected submission for svelte hack 2023, and the theme that best fits my submission is best wizzbangery (wizard bangery ?)

also, when i think of this project i think of imagemagick (the logo) but text formatting edition

## todo:
- keyboard shortcuts
- custom modules
- save recipe in localstorage
- fix calculate being not defined in custom JS function (by nonobvious method)
- similarly to above, bundle necessary functions when custom JS
- create docs (not fun)
- settings page
- module lazy loading
- ctrl-f to find in text
- execute for each has a special "index" tag

## module ideas:
- execute if condition
- fib sequence
- jtr double
- register logic
- random char from chars
- random number
